# Anchor Program Deployment Guide

Welcome to the **Anchor Program Deployment Guide**! This document provides a step-by-step walkthrough to deploy your Anchor program on the Solana blockchain. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will help you navigate the process with ease.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before diving into deployment, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured on your system:

1. **Node.js**: Verify installation by running:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. **Solana CLI**: Verify installation by running:

   ```bash
   solana --version
   ```

3. **Anchor CLI**: Verify installation by running:

   ```bash
   anchor --version
   ```

If any of these tools are missing, visit their official documentation for installation instructions.

## 🚀 Steps to Deploy

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

1. **Clone the Project Repository**:
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/infoparth/token_buy_repo.git
   cd token-buy-repo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use Yarn (recommended) or npm to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Solana CLI**:
   Set the Solana network to `devnet` (or `mainnet-beta`/`testnet` as needed):

   ```bash
   solana config set --url devnet
   ```

   Ensure your Solana wallet is configured and funded. If you’re using `devnet`, you can airdrop SOL using:

   ```bash
   solana airdrop 5
   ```

### 2. Deploy the Program and Verify

1. **Retrieve the Program Address**:
   First of all, create the program’s address from a new keypair($PROGRAM_ID):

   ```bash
   solana-keygen new --outfile program-keypair.json
   ```

   The output is your **Program ID**. Update the ProgramID in Anchor.toml,

   ```toml
   [programs.devnet]
   token_biu = "Program ID"  -- For Devnet

   [programs.mainnet]
   token_biu = "Program ID"  -- For Mainnet
   ```

   and in lib.rs

   ```rust
   declare_id!("Program ID");
   ```


2. **Build the Program**:
   Compile your Anchor program by running:

   ```bash
   solana-verify build
   ```

3. **Check the compiled Program Hash**:
   Check the Hash of your built binary:

   ```bash
   solana-verify get-executable-hash target/deploy/token_biu.so
   ```

4. **Deploy the Program**:
   Deploy your program to the Solana blockchain:

   For Devnet:

   ```bash
   solana program deploy -u https://api.devnet.solana.com target/deploy/token_biu.so --program-id program-keypair.json --with-compute-unit-price 10000 --max-sign-attempts 1000 --use-rpc
   ```

   For Mainnet: Use a RPC from Helius($HELIUS_RPC) so that you don't get rate limting.

   ```bash
   solana program deploy -u $HELIUS_RPC target/deploy/token_biu.so --program-id program-keypair.json --with-compute-unit-price 10000 --max-sign-attempts 1000 --use-rpc
   ```


   **Note**: If you encounter an "insufficient funds" error, ensure your wallet is funded. For `devnet`, use:

   ```bash
   solana airdrop 5
   ```

5. **Verify the on-chain hash**
   Get the hash of the deployed program on-chain, and compare it with the hash obtained in Step 2:

   For Devnet: 

   ```bash
   solana-verify get-program-hash -ud $NETWORK_URL $PROGRAM_ID
   ```

   For Mainnet: 

   ```bash
   solana-verify get-program-hash -um $NETWORK_URL $PROGRAM_ID
   ```

   If the hash matches, then proceed further

6. **Verify the deployment locally against the repository**:
   To verify the program against the public repository, use:

   For Devnet:

   ```bash
   solana-verify verify-from-repo -ud --program-id $PROGRAM_ID https://github.com/infoparth/token_buy_repo --commit-hash $COMMIT_HASH --library-name token_biu
   ```

   For Mainnet:

   ```bash
   solana-verify verify-from-repo -um --program-id $PROGRAM_ID https://github.com/infoparth/token_buy_repo --commit-hash $COMMIT_HASH --library-name token_biu 
   ```

7. **Verify the deployment against a public API**:
   Works only on the mainnet.

   ```bash
   solana-verify verify-from-repo --remote -um --program-id $PROGRAM_ID https://github.com/infoparth/token_buy_repo
   ```   
---

### 3. Configure the Client

To get the program IDL, run the following command before verify step i.e Step 5 for Devnet, and on mainnet, after step 7

   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```

If faced with the error

   ```error
   Permission Denied
   ```

run the command 

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
   anchor build
   ```

1. **Update the IDL**:
   Anchor automatically generates an IDL (Interface Definition Language) file during the build process. Locate it in the `target/idl/` directory.

2. **Copy the IDL**:
   Replace the existing IDL in your frontend code with the newly generated one. Place it in:

   ```
   constants/token_idl.json
   ```

3. **Update the Token Address**:
   In the `constants/constants.js` file, replace the old `token_buy` address with the new one.

4. **Initialize the Token Sale**:
   Run the `Initialize` component to set up the token sale. Provide the following details:
   - **Recipient Address**: The wallet address that will receive SOL from the sale.
   - **Mint Address**: The token mint address.
   - **Authority**: The wallet signing the transaction will have the authority to pause/resume the sale and update the recipient/authority in the future.

## 🔄 Changing the Period for Monthly Limits

The program supports dynamic periods for monthly limits, which can be configured manually in the `constants.rs` file. Here's how:

1. **Open `constants.rs`**:
   Locate the `constants.rs` file in your project:

   ```
   src/constants.rs
   ```

2. **Change the Period**:
   Update the `PERIOD` constant to one of the following:

   - **Hourly**: For hourly periods (1 hour).
   - **Daily**: For daily periods (24 hours).
   - **Monthly**: For monthly periods (~30.44 days).

   Example:

   ```rust
   // Change this line to set the desired period
   pub const PERIOD: Period = Period::Hourly; // or Period::Daily, Period::Monthly
   ```

3. **Rebuild and Redeploy**:
   After changing the period, rebuild and redeploy the program:

   ```bash
   anchor build
   anchor deploy
   ```

4. **Verify the Changes**:
   The program will now use the updated period for all calculations, such as monthly limits and time-based checks.
